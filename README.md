# My dotfiles

Managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).  
Use Stow to create symlinks for a specific directory (usually a single application) by running:  
`stow i3`

Or create symlinks for all directories:  
`stow */`

`_HomeDir` now relies on [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k). Install this and the recommended font.
